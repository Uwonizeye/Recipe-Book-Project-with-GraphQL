      This Spaghetti recipe has been made for three generations in our family.  Some changes have appeared over the years, like the addition of the cinnamon and cumin (a tip I picked up from a caterer) and the fact that we have switched to whole grain pasta for better health and taste.  Please do not be picky about amounts.  I keep all my spaghetti spice jars in one box and just take the whole box out when I make spaghetti and throw in handfuls of this and that without measuring.  I just group the spices by lots, little bits, or pinches.  Fresh vegetables can be used diced, or hidden from the kids by blending.  The best part about this dish is that all the ingredients can be taken right from the cupboard (except the ground beef, which can be frozen) and spice mixes can be made up ahead to save time.  A packet of spice mix, a jar of home-canned tomatoes, and a fancy wooden pasta server make a beautiful housewarming gift.

      My mother taught me this recipe when I moved out.  I come from a large family and she made big pots full of the stuff.  We?re not Italian, but we still love our spaghetti.

      <ingredients>
      2 lbs ground beef
2 cups diced fresh vegetables like peppers, carrots, celery, or whatever (Optional)
1 Tablespoon onion powder (or a diced onion)
1 Tablespoon garlic powder (or some chopped garlic)
2 cans of diced tomatoes or one 1.5 litre jar of home-canned tomatoes
2 shakes Worcestershire sauce
1 Tablespoon brown sugar
1 Tablespoon basil
1 Tablespoon oregano
1 teaspoon thyme
1 teaspoon sea salt
pinch cinnamon
pinch cumin
pinch cayenne
one 900g package white spaghetti or two 375g packages whole grain spaghetti
3 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
grated old cheddar cheese (for garnish)
parmesan cheese (for garnish)
purple basil flakes (for garnish)
      </ingredients>
      <directions>
      Start by browning the ground beef.  (If it is still frozen, leave it in a covered low-heat pot for about 20 minutes while you do something else like chop vegetables.)  Break up the meat, but leave some chunks for pseudo-meatballs if you wish.  Mix fresh vegetables, onion and garlic with the cooked meat and saut? until tender.  (Alternately, put some tomatoes in the blender with the vegetables and spices, and blend.) Add tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, and spices (or tomato puree) to the meat mixture and stir until it begins to boil.  Lower the heat to a simmer and cover.  Move it to a back burner to continue simmering until pasta is ready.  Cook the spaghetti (or pasta of your choice--we like spaghettini) following package directions.  After draining the cooking water from the pasta, toss in some extra virgin olive oil to keep the pasta from sticking to itself while waiting to be served.  Serve sauce with pasta, grated parmesan cheese, and grated cheddar cheese.  An extra sprinkling of dried purple basil leaves from last summer?s garden finishes the look.  Serves 8.

      A final gift from GLaDOS, this cake recipe is delicious at first
glance but quickly reveals its killer intent. Remove ingredients as necessary
to increase likelihood of human consumption. Note that it does contain
proven preservatives, deep penetration agents, and gas and odour control
chemicals that will deodorize and preserve putrid tissue.

      This Vegan Banana Muffin recipe is a delicious breakfast or snack that is both wholesome, healthy, and delicious. A variation of this recipe is to add 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips before baking. If you don't have extra bananas, add more sugar and oil. If you don't have cardamom, just add more cinnamon. Remember not to over cook.

      "This rich and moist spice cake, full of grated carrot and toasted nuts, has great flavour,
especially when covered with a tangy and sweet flavoured cream cheese frosting.
The interesting part is that while those pretty orange flecks of grated carrot give the Carrot Cake colour and texture,
along with sweetness and moisture, its' flavour is almost indistinguishable."

      <ingredients>
      1 cup (100 grams) pecans or walnuts
3/4 pound (340 grams) raw carrots (about 2 1/2 cups finely grated)
2 cups (260 grams) all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
4 large eggs
1 1/2 cups (300 grams) granulated white sugar
1 cup (240 ml) safflower, vegetable or canola oil (or other flavourless oil)
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
Cream Cheese Frosting:
1/4 cup (57 grams) unsalted butter, room temperature
8 ounces (227 grams) cream cheese, room temperature
2 cups (230 grams) confectioners (powdered or icing) sugar, sifted
1 teaspoon (4 grams) pure vanilla extract
1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest (outer yellow skin)
      </ingredients>
      <directions>
      Carrot Cake:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) and place rack in center of oven. Butter or spray two - 9 x 2 inch (23 x 5 cm)
cake pans and line the bottoms of the pans with a circle of parchment paper.
Toast the pecans or walnuts for about 8 minutes or until lightly browned and fragrant. Let cool and then chop coarsely.
Peel and finely grate the carrots. Set aside.
In a separate bowl whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and ground cinnamon. Set aside.
In bowl of electric mixer (or with a hand mixer), beat the eggs until frothy (about 1 minute). Gradually add the sugar
and beat until the batter is thick and light coloured (about 3 - 4 minutes). Add the oil in a steady stream and then beat in the vanilla extract.
Add the flour mixture and beat just until incorporated. With a large rubber spatula fold in the grated carrots and chopped nuts.
Evenly divide the batter between the two prepared pans and bake 25 to 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Remove from oven and let cool on a wire rack. After about 5 -10 minutes invert the cakes onto the wire rack, remove the pans and parchment paper,
and then cool completely before frosting.
To assemble: place one cake layer, top side down, onto your serving plate. Spread with about one third of the frosting.
Gently place the other cake, top of cake facing down, onto the frosting, and spread the rest of the frosting over the top and sides of the cake.
If desired, press toasted and finely chopped nuts on the sides of the cake and decorate the top of the cake with marzipan carrots (see below).
Cover and refrigerate any leftovers.
Serves 10 - 12.
Cream Cheese Frosting:
In bowl of electric mixer (or with a hand mixer), beat the cream cheese and butter,
on low speed, just until blended with no lumps. Gradually add the sifted powdered sugar and beat, on low speed,
until fully incorporated and smooth.  Beat in the vanilla extract, and lemon zest.

      This is a very common meat dish in hungary, generaly using beef, as well as their most common spice, paprika. Best served with either a traditional egg dumpling called spaetzle (austrian name) or galuska (hungarian name), or plain rice. You can also do this in a slow cooker and let it cook for longer. If you like a little spice you can heat this dish up by adding some jalopeno peppers while simmering and then cut them up and mix it in individualy.

      Jerk is a method of cooking meats that comes from the original inhabitants of Jamaica, the Arawaks. They roasted meats over fires of pimento wood from the allspice tree. Pimento wood gave a distinctive flavor to the meat and is still used for jerk grilling in Jamaica. Jerk marinades and rubs are often quite spicy with Scotch bonnet peppers. Recipes vary widely, but true jerk seasoning contains allspice. This recipe is for chicken, but pork, goat and even fish are also jerked.

      Phytoplankton Flambe is an extremely rare dish that is generally not made in today's society,
and has never been made before. This dish would be very popular in coastal communities if they made it.
Since it has been criticized, at times, of not having enough paprika, this appetizer is not well-recieved,
internationally. An international delicacy, Phytoplankton Flambe is perhaps one of the most abundant and
easily accessible dishes that can be ordered in any restaurant around the world.

Exactly one pinch of salt
1 green onion
1 gallon of paprika
1 tomato
200 mg of paprika
      </ingredients>
      <directions>
      Peel and thinly slice the green onion. Toss the phytoplankton and green onion into a bowl and mix.
Now, add a pinch of salt. Next, add 1 gallon of paprika. Then, slowly add the 200 mg of paprika, while mixing.
At this point the paprika should completely overpower the rest of the dish and you should be left with basically
a bowl of paprika. Now throw out the tomato. Mix the paprika thoroughly. Finally, drench it in gasoline and throw
a match on it, and you have Phytoplankton Flambe.

      This is my Grandma's homemade recipe.  Since I am half Polish, pierogies are highly favoured in our family.  They are always made on special occasions and holidays, such as Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Sour cream in the dough is the secret to a great tasting pierogie!!

      <ingredients>
      2 cups flour, plus extra for kneading and rolling dough
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 large egg
1/2 cup sour cream, plus extra to serve with the pierogi
1/4 cup butter, softened and cut into small pieces
butter and onions for sauteing
      </ingredients>
      <directions>
      To prepare the pierogi dough, mix together the flour and salt. Beat the egg, then add all at once to the flour mixture. Add the 1/2 cup sour cream and the softened butter pieces and work until the dough loses most of its stickiness (about 5-7 minutes). You can use a food processor with a dough hook for this, but be careful not to overbeat. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for 20-30 minutes or overnight; the dough can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Each batch of dough makes about 12-15 pierogies, depending on size. Roll the pierogi dough on a floured board or countertop until 1/8" thick. Cut circles of dough (2" for small pierogies and 3-3 1/2" for large pierogies) with a cookie cutter or drinking glass. Place a small ball of filling (about a tablespoon) on each dough round and fold the dough over, forming a semi-circle. Press the edges together with the tines of a fork. Boil the perogies a few at a time in a large pot of water. They are done when they float to the top (about 8-10 minutes). Rinse in cool water and let dry. Saute chopped onions in butter in a large pan until onions are soft. Then add pierogies and pan fry until lightly crispy. Serve with a side of sour cream for a true Pittsburgh pierogi meal.

      Let's consider this a rough outline because I never cook it the same way. It's probably similar to many other recipes of stri-fried tofu. It's nice because it'll be ready in less than twenty minutes, there's a wide range of flavors, and lots of room to experiment with spices and other vegetables. This should be enough for a one person dinner.

      100g of tofu
Olive or canola oil for the pan
A few leaves of kale
A medium sized stalk (and head) of brocoli
One medium zucchini
Some cauliflower
A medium onion
As much garlic as you like
Enough Tamari sauce
Black pepper to taste
A few raw almonds can be nice

      <directions>
      Pour some olive oil in a pan.
Cut the tofu in small cubes.
Add cubes to the pan, heat the pan at a level just below medium.
Add Tamari sauce so that every cube of tofu can soak up some of it.
Move the cubes around so that each side can get lightly fried.
Once the tofu shows a light yellow-brown coat, add cut cauliflower and brocoli.
Add zucchini, sliced the way you like to slice that kind of stuff.
Add onion, cut however you like.
Add raw almonds if you think it'll taste good.
Add kale and ground fresh garlic toward the end, which is when you the cauliflower is softened up just enough.
Kale cooks fast, so during the last couple of minutes you can add ground black pepper and any other spice you like.

      Stuffed Cabbage Rolls are the epitome of comfort food.
Pork and beef mixed with rice or barley are nestled in a cabbage leaf
and cooked in the oven or on the stove until tender.
It is traditional Polish food and are called golabki
which literally means "little pigeons." Usually, the sauce is
what sets them apart.

      <ingredients>
      1 whole head cabbage, about 4 pounds
1 large onion, chopped
2 tablespoons butter
1 pound ground beef
1/2 pound ground pork
1 1/2 cups cooked rice
1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 cup beef stock
Sour cream for garnish (optional)
      </ingredients>
      <directions>
      Heat oven to 350 degrees.
Remove core from cabbage. Place whole head in a large pot filled with boiling, salted water. Cover and cook 3 minutes, or until softened enough to pull off individual leaves. You will need about 18 leaves.
When leaves are cool enough to handle, use a paring knife to cut away the thick center stem from each leaf, without cutting all the way through.
Chop the remaining cabbage and place it in the bottom of a casserole dish or Dutch oven.
Saute the chopped onion in butter in a large frying pan until tender, and let it cool.
Mix cooled onions with beef, pork, rice, garlic, salt and black pepper until well combined. Don't overmix or the meat will become tough.
Place about 1/2 cup of meat on each cabbage leaf. Roll away from you to encase the meat. Flip the right side of the leaf to the middle, then flip the left side. You will have something that looks like an envelope. Once again, roll away from you to create a neat little roll.
Place the cabbage rolls on top of the chopped cabbage in the casserole dish or Dutch oven, seasoning each layer with salt and pepper. Pour beef stock over rolls, cover and place in oven. Bake for 1 hour or until cabbage is tender and meat is cooked.
Serve with pan juices and a drizzle of sour cream, or mix the pan juices with sour cream and ladle it over the cabbage rolls.
Cabbage rolls freeze well before or after cooking, and can be made in a slow cooker (see your manufacturer's instructions).
Note: Since they can be eaten hot or at room temperature, mini cabbage rolls make great appetizers. Just spear them with a frilled toothpick and you're good to go!

      This is the most traditional Polish dish. It is also known as "Hunter's stew".
There is no one, unique recipe for this dish and it varies depending on the region and family traditions.
Typical ingredients are sauerkraut, white cabbage, various cuts of meat and sausages.
It is mostly eaten with bread. The interesting fact about Bigos is that the longer it is kept in a cool
place, its flavour intensifies and taste is even better. It is often served during Christmas.
